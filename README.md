# Advent of Code 2021
Solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

Once again, I participated in Advent of Code for practice and fun. Here you'll find solutions clever and comical,
flawed and forgettable. Some done in a rush in the middle of the night, and (eventually) some done months later and
carefully refined for performance or simply to try out a new language feature.

This year I'm hoping to lower the time committment by solving first in C#. I will likely end up solving some in other
languages and will track which solutions I've done, using the chart below.

## Results
I've added `output.txt` as a reference for my answers (for convenient checking while refactoring) and runtimes of my solutions.

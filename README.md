# Advent of Code 2018 - Rust edition

This project is a learning exercise for the [Rust Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/). The reader is encouraged NOT to emulate techniques found here, as they are the hairbrained attempts of a Rust noob with insufficient neural plasticity.

The goal will be to improve the solutions over time, as my understanding of the language allows. Suggestions welcome.

# Advent of Code 2020
Solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

Once again, I'm participating in Advent of Code for practice and fun. Here you'll find solutions clever and comical,
flawed and forgettable. Some done in a rush in the middle of the night, and (eventually) some done months later and
carefully refined for performance or simply to try out a new language feature.

This year, like the last two, I'm primarily practicing Rust, which (regrettably) I have rarely used in the other
eleven months of the year. I expect I may solve some in other languages or be forced, in vintage AoC fashion, to solve
by hand in a text editor.
